Executive Summary Comparison
----------------------------

- **Llama 3.1:**  
  The cooling system is currently maintaining a stable operating temperature across all five CDUs. Active cooling is provided by tower units, while cabinet valves regulate temperature precisely.

- **Qwen 3-8B:**  
  The system shows stable temperature deviations with minimal fluctuations. However, the cooling tower is operating at very low capacity (`action 0`), which may be causing reduced cooling efficiency. Cabinet 5 has a significant temperature deviation of **-13.62K**.

Cooling Assessment
------------------

- **Llama 3.1:**  
  The control goal is to **maintain current temperature levels** without further action.

- **Qwen 3-8B:**  
  Extremely low tower cooling action may **reduce overall system cooling capacity**, possibly affecting effectiveness in high-load scenarios.

Short-Term Recommendation
--------------------------

- **Llama 3.1:**  
  Monitor temperature and workload distributions. Adjust valve positions if necessary.

- **Qwen 3-8B:**  
  Increase tower operation to a **moderate level** to improve heat rejection and **reduce overcooling** risks.

Qwen 3-8B: Short Explanation
----------------------------

**Explanation:**  
The system adjusted valve positions across all cabinets to balance cooling performance and energy efficiency. Tower cooling was set low due to stable temperature trends.

- **Temperature impact:**
  - All temperatures are within normal range with minor deviations.
  - Very low tower cooling may limit fine control.

- **Energy efficiency:**
  - Low tower usage contributes to **moderate energy savings**.

- **Inference time:** 1.11 seconds

Qwen 3-8B: Detailed Explanation
-------------------------------


**Executive Summary:**  
Qwen 3-8B keeps system temperatures stable and emphasizes energy efficiency.

- **Temperature stability:**
  - Most cabinets operate within expected norms.
  - **Cabinet 5 shows abnormal deviation** (-13.62K), possibly due to overcooling.

- **Valve actions:**
  - Even valve distribution across cabinets and blade groups.
  - Cooling tower set to low (`action 0`), improving efficiency but reducing capacity.

- **Cabinet temperature:**
  - Cabinet 5's deviation may indicate inefficiency or control imbalance.

- **Energy efficiency:**
  - Considered **moderate**.
  - Low tower usage reduces energy cost, but system responsiveness may suffer.

- **Action rationale:**
  - Control decisions were based on observed temperature ranges.
  - While performance is good, overcooling risk should be monitored.

- **Inference time:** 4.91 seconds
