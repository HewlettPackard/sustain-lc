Custom Carbon Intensity Data
============================

Carbon Intensity (CI) data represents the carbon emissions associated with electricity consumption.  
Green-DCC includes CI data files for various locations to simulate the carbon footprint of the DCâ€™s energy usage.

Data Source
-----------

The default carbon intensity data files are extracted from:

- U.S. Energy Information Administration API (`EBA bulk download`_)  

.. _EBA bulk download: https://api.eia.gov/bulk/EBA.zip

Expected File Format
--------------------

Carbon intensity files should be in ``.csv`` format, with columns representing different energy sources and the average carbon intensity.  The columns typically include:

- ``timestamp``: The time of the data entry
- ``WND``: Wind energy
- ``SUN``: Solar energy
- ``WAT``: Hydropower energy
- ``OIL``: Oil energy
- ``NG``: Natural gas energy
- ``COL``: Coal energy
- ``NUC``: Nuclear energy
- ``OTH``: Other energy sources
- ``avg_CI``: The average carbon intensity

   ...

Integration Steps
-----------------

- Add your new carbon intensity CSV files to the ``data/CarbonIntensity/`` folder.
- In ``hierarchical_env.py``, update the ``DEFAULT_CONFIG['cintensity_file']`` entry to point at your new file.
